			What's New?	Speed Cars Demo

0,2 : There is not a big diffirence from SCD 0,1 to 0,2 but 0,2 is a more finished	version of 0,1. In 0,1 there were a few bugs with the collisions. Most of these bugs have now been "patched". Also the "time" and a few of the textures have been upgraded. The only new thing in 0,2 is the "Highscore" and the options menu!

			In the next version of Speed Cars:

0,3 : - Split screen multiplayer
      - Several tracks (at least three!)
      - New design
      - Ghosts
      - More languages
      + More!
