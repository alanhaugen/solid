The game is still under construction and does not represent the quality of the final game.

In the full version:

* 4 cups - three tracks on each of them... (3x4)
* 3 vechiles
* Lan - Internet
* More than two languages... (Norwegian and English!)
* Sounds and music
* Better physics and collision detection (the way the car "hits" the wall)
* + more!
