	Speed Cars Demo	v.0,4	 		      04.07.2005 - 23.12.2006


note: This is the last version of Speed Cars, and I have'nt really bothered doing updating this readme file (actually, most of the things are pretty unchanged..) or anything, so here's a quick note.
I've added a new track, track 1. The highscores for this track will not get stored, because I'm to lazy to put it in.
Anyway, hope you enjoy playing! 


This is a demo of a freeware racing game made by Diamond Softworks and is actually the very first game they have ever made!
If you find any bugs, please send an e-mail to games@gebori.com
We hope you enjoy playing this demo and will look out for the next demo version!

The game is still under construction and does not represent the quality of the final game.

1.) What's New
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

See WHATSNEW.TXT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.) System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game should work on just about anything that can run windows 95 or higher!

Minimum Requirements

OS : Windows 95 or higher
CPU: Pentium 100 Mhz or higher
Ram: 64 MB ram
Gfx: 4 MB DirectX 7-compatible D3D video card
-    16-bit DirectX 7-compatible sound card
-    DirectX 7 or higher


That SHOULD be able to play Speed Cars! Because there are not any other Gfx
options than the default, I dont think I need to write recommended (etc.) requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speed cars is made for people who are bored in the spare time at school.
Breaking eachothers records and luaghing at the ones who are not as good as you has brightened up our spare time at 8A in Tranby school...

Hope you like this demo, it does not have the quality of the final product, but who cares anyway..............?
