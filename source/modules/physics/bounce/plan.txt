====================
| Mach's Principle |
====================

 * Gravity from other bodies affect how things spin and move.
 * Ernst Mach, Østerrike
 * Newton thought space had only absolute coordinates
 * Mach believed space had only relative coordinates
 * Inspired by Gottfried Leibniz, the guy behind Newton's mathematics
 * Mass is the sum of the Mm (molecular mass) of all the atoms in an object
 * Albert Einstein discovered that mass is energy: E = mc^2
 * Galileo Galilei proposed inertia in the 17th centuary
 * Inertia is Newton's first law, F1.
 * F1: If the sum of all forces on an object is equal to 0 => velocity will be unchanged
 * A universe with only one object, inertia loses its meaning
 * The universe probably exists of subatomic particles which are continually created and destroyed

===========================
| Newton's laws of motion |
===========================

 * Isaac Newton was influential and contentious
 * Used calculus to explain gravity
 * Discovored white light is made up of all visible colours
 * Motorcicles can mount a vertical wall of death
 * Cyclists can race on inclined tracks
 * Newton began by reading great works of mathematics
 * F1: Sum of forces acting on a object = 0 => constant speed
 * A force supplies an acceleration
 * A force changes the acceleration of an object
 * Acceleration is a change in speed over some time
 * Heavy objects need a greater force to change acceleration greatly
 * Weight is the same as inertia
 * F2: F = ma (which explains 1kg cannonball or 1 kg feather with no atmosphere experiment...)
 * F3: F = 'F

=================
| Kepler's laws |
=================

 * Johannes Kepler looked for patterns
 * Discovered the laws which govern the orbits of planets
 * Planets follow elliptical orbits and move faster close to the sun
 * Lays foundation for Newton's law of gravity
 * Kepler thought the world was made up of polygons
 * Nicolas Copernicus proposed posthumously that the Sun was the centre of the Universe
 * Ptolemy was an ancient greek who popularised the idea of the Earth being the centre
 * Kepler believed in Copernius's heliocentric idea
 * Planet is from greek where it means 'wanderer'
 * K1: Orbits are elliptical and the sun is at one focus
 * K2: "A planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times as it orbits the Sun"
 * K3: "the orbital periods scale wit hellipse size, such that the period squared is proportionmal to the semi-major axis length cubed

===============================
| Newton's law of gravitation |
===============================

 * All bodies attract each-other with the force if gravity
 * That force drops off with distance^2
 * Planets move more quickly close to the Sun because of the law of gravitation
 * All objects exerts a gravitational force in proportion to its mass
 * Archaeologists sometimes use tiny gravity changes on earth to spot buried settlements
 * Newton wrote about gravity in Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (Principia, 1687)
 * Principia explains the motions of most things; of planets, moons, projectiles, pendulums, apples etc.
 * Newton could explain the orbits of comets, formation of tides and the wobbling of Earth's axis
 * General relativity by Einstein succeeds the law of gravity

==========================
| Conservation of energy |
==========================

 * Energy is an animating force, it makes things move or change
 * Energy may be a change in speed, or a change in height
 * Energy is conserved, it will never be created or destroyed
 * Energy may be travelling electromagnetic waves or vibrations of atoms (heat)
 * Energy can change form, called metamorphosis
 * Physicists do not know what energy is
 * Energy is a property of matter and space
 * Energy can create, move or change
 * Since the greeks energy is considered an essence which gives life to objects
 * Galileo discovered that energy can metamporphose
 * When moving on earth you usually use gravitational potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE)
 * PE: E = mgh
 * KE: E = (mv^2)/2
 * Energy can be temporarily stored in many different ways (compressed spring, heat)
 * Energy can be transmitted in many different ways (electromagnetic waves, chemical energy released by chemical reactions)
 * Destroying atoms releases energy: E = mc^2
 * Sun energy is more than enough to power our needs if we find a way to harness it
 * Energy used to be called life force or "vis viva" (Leibniz)
 * Thomas Young introduced to word energy
 * Momentum is also conserved. There is linear momentum and angular momentum. Momentum has a vector and size, angular momentum is linear momentum + rotation point

==========================
| Simple harmonic motion |
==========================

 * Vibration can be a simple harmonic motion
 * Add small extra forces to an harmonic mation and it may precipitate disaster, it is otherwise very predictable. Watch out for resonance
 * Jump on a bed, pluck a guitar, swing a light cord; they are all harmonic motions
 * The earth's rotation affects pendulums

===============
| Hooke's law |
===============

 * Shows how materials deform when forcse are applied
 * Hook also named the cell in biology
 * H: F = -kx
 * Materials that obey Hooke's law are also elastic
 * Elastic materials will always return to their original shape after a force has stopped working on it
 * Many materials will be elastic, but can break or fail if the force is too great
 * Stiffness is called elastic modulus
 * The stiffer the material, the greater force is needed to change it
 * Diamond, silicon carbide and tungsten are very stiff
 * Aluminium alloy and woord are very pliable, the opposite of stiff
 * A material being streched is under strain
 * The force applied per unit area is called stress
 * How stiff material is must be taken into account when making a building
 * Hooke's law is used at sea to help in navigation, accurate timetelling with a chromometer and the longtitude of the Sun or stars in the sky you can pinpoint your position

=================
| Ideal gas law |
=================

 * Pressure, volume and temperature of a gas are linked
 * pV = nRT
 * A pressure cooker is sealed and increase in pressure will allow the temperature of water get above 100 degrees centigrade
 * An ideal gas follows the ideal gas law
 * An ideal gas has small molecules or atoms compared to the distance between them
 * An ideal gas has no electrical charges between atoms and they bounce off each other cleanly
 * Noble gasses behave like ideal gases
 * When you climb a mountain the pressure decreases and water will cook at lower than 100 degrees. Food will not cook well without a pressure cooker
 * There is no such thing as a vacuum

================================
| Second law of thermodynamics |
================================

 * T2: Heat travels from hot bodies to cold bodies
 * Heat is a measure of disorder; entropy
 * Entropy will always increase in an isolated system
 * T2: Entropoy increases; never decreases (in a bounded system)
 * Life is to fight entropy
 * James Clark Maxwell envisioned a demon machine, Maxwell's demon snatch fast molecules from one box and into another, and otherwise be closed...

=================
| Absolute zero |
=================

 * t = T + 273.15
 * 0*C = 273.15 K
 * -273.15*C = 0 K

===================
| Brownian motion |
===================

 * Particles jiggle because of invisible molecules and water
 * Botanist Robert Brown first spotted it as the twitching of pollen particles on his microscope slides
 * Albert Einstein was the first to describe it mathematically
 * Brownian motion describes many random processess
 * Brownian motion is a fractal
 * Brownian motion can be used to create terrain in video-games

================
| Chaos theory |
================

 * Small changes can have major ramifications
 * A tiny wind eddy can seed a large hurricane on the other side of the planet; the butterfly effect
 * Chaos is not literally chaotic, it creates patterns
 * Similar starting points may create very different outcomes

======================
| Bernoulli equation |
======================

 * There is a relationship between speed and pressure in flowing fluids
 * Bernoulli's equation governs aeroplanes, blood flows, fuel injected into engines, etc
 * The faster the fluid flows, the lower the pressure

=============================
| Newton's theory of colour |
=============================

 * White light shun at a prism spreads the rays into a rainbow of colours
 * Colour is not a proporty of an object, instead an object will reflect certain colours, hence why you see something as a certain colour
 * Light behaves a little like water, bending around obstacles like sea waves around a harbour wall
 * A prism bends light depending on the wavelength of the light
 * Shadows often take the opposite colour of the illuminated object
 * The colour wheel was invented by Newton and improved by Goethe, the primary colours are red, blue, yellow and magenta

======================
| Huygens' principle |
======================

 * Imagine every point on a wavefront is a new ripple source
 * A new ripple source has the same frequency and phase as the wavefront
 * Waves always move forwards, the backwards wave, behind the back side of a wavefront, is ignored

===============
| Snell's law |
===============

 * Light travels at different speeds in different materials, which will make the rays bend
 * This also explains road mirages
 * Light can refract (Snell's law), reflect, diffract (bounce back, Snell's law) or interfere (with other light rays)
 * Materials have a refractive index
 * Farmat's least time says light uses the least time to get through any substance
 * An Opal is a natural meta-material, a material designed to look a certain way based on physical structure rather than its chemistry...

===============
| Bragg's law |
===============

 * B: 2d(istance) sin theta (angle of incidence of the light) = n lambda
 * Explains diffraction and interference of light
 * X-rays shot through a crystal creates patterns of dots explained by light travelling as a wave interfering with other rays
 * X-ray crystallography is used to determine the structure of new materials
 * Chemists and biologists use it to reaveal molecular arcitectures, for example DNA

==========================
| Fraunhofer diffraction |
==========================

 * Light rays are always percieved blurred
 * Franhofer diffraction, also called far-field diffraction, describes this blurring, at least for parallell lines
 * There is a diffraction limit for all images, it explains how clear an image can become
 * The more you open your eyes, the more light comes in but the more blurred it will be
 * Images taken with a larger arperture or lens are clearer, blue light is always clearer since the diffraction depends on wavelength
 * Light spreads out when it goes through a narrow opening, the narrower the more it spreads
 * A round arperture creates round rings named Airy rings after Scottish physicist George Airy
 * The first gratings were made by Fraunhofer to study inergerence

==================
| Doppler effect |
==================

 * Change of pitch as things move past you
 * High pitch on approach, low pitch as it recedes
 * The Doppler effect applies to any objects moving relative to one another
 * Used to catch speeding drivers, and to measure blood flow
 * Doppler effect also affects planets which move towards us (and become blue shifted) and away from us (which become red shifted)

=============
| Ohm's law |
=============

 * O: V= IR
 * Electricity is the movement of electric charge
 * Electric charge, like energy, is consevered; it can not be created or destroyed, it can however be moved around
 * Robert Millikan measered the negative charge of electrons in 1909
 * In a storm, molecules in the clouds build up a lot of negative charge
 * Electric current is a flow of charge
 * Metals are said to be conductors of electricity, electrons in metal are not tied to particular atomic nuclei
 * Electrons move through metals like water through a pipe
 * Isolators do not let electricity flow through them
 * Semiconductors allow electricity to flow them only under certain conditions
 * Current is similar to flow speed, voltage like the pressure of water and resistance is like to width or arperture restrictions

=============================
| Fleming's right hand rule |
=============================

 * Electromagnetic induction: A magnet and a coil of wire, spin the magnet inside the coil of wire and you get an electrical current
 * The direction of the induced current is given by Fleming's right hand rule
 * The right hand rule is named after Scottish engineer John Ambrose Fleming
 * Move the magnet more quickly, or wind the coils more tightly; the current increases
 * Electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday
 * Charge can be stored in capacitors
 * Transformer: A magnetic ring with two separated wire coils wrapped around it, one field induces a current in a nearby coil by induction, used to lower voltage (?)

=======================
| Maxwell's equations |
=======================

 * M1: a dot b = p  (Gauss's law, shape and strength of electric fields generated by a charged object)
 * M2: a cross H = J + (delta d/delta t)  (describes shape and strength of an electric field around a magnet)
 * M3: a dot B = O  (electromagnetic induction)
 * M4: a cross e = -(delta B/delta t)  (electromagnetic induction)
 * Maxwell's equations are the best equations since the universal law of gravitation
 * The equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are two sides of the same coin
 * Electric and magnetic fields are electromagnetic waves
 * The equations describe the entire field of electricity and magnetism
 * Light is electromagnetic waves, they travel at 3*10^8 m/s
 * An electromagnetic wave has a wavelength, radio waves are the longest (km), visible light are about as long sa the space between atoms, x-rays are the shortest
 * f = c/lambda  (the shorter the wavelength, the greater the frequency and the greater the energy it carries)
 * Fields are the way forces are transmitted across a distance
 * Eienstein took Maxwell's equations and managed to truly, properly unite magnetism and electricity

================
| Planck's law |
================

 * Max Planck explained why metals go through the visible colours from those of long wavelengths to those of short wavelengths when heated up
 * Planck described light and heat statistically instead of thinking of it as a wave
 * This was the start of quantum physics
 * The spread of colours (many colours at once) when heating something is called the black-body curve, it peaks at a bluish colour
 * The hotter the star on the sky, the bluer it becomes
 * Black objects absorb and release heat better than white objects. A white object will cool down, such as the ice caps cooling down our planet
 * P: E = hv (v is frequency of the light)
 * Planck's units are called quanta: "how much"
 * Released his law explaining the black-body spectrum in 1901

========================
| Photoelectric effect |
========================

 * Eienstein showed how light could behave like a stream of photons and as a continous wave
 * Metals generate electric currents when blue or ultraviolet light is shun on them, but not by light of longer wavelengths
 * The treshold of the light which can generate electricity in metals varies from metal to metal
 * The treshold needs to be reached before electricity is generated or released
 * Electromagnetic waves and moving charges seemed to be two different things, Einstein helped unite them
 * Einstein applied Planck's theory to light instead of atoms...
 * Light quanta: Photons
 * All bodies have a wavelength, all matter has a particle-wave duality
 * Large objects have such tiny wavelengths they can not be observed

===============================
| Schrödinger's wave equation |
===============================

 * Equation which describes how a wave moves while behaving as a wave
 * Described energy levels of electrons in atoms and started modern chemistry and quantum mechanics
 * White light shun through a cold gas will be partially absorbed by the electrons in the gas and will be blacked out
 * Schrödinger's equation can describe how the orbitals looks like, they look like donuts and dumb-bells

======================================
| Heisenberg's uncertainty principle |
======================================

 * Particles are not deterministic
 * The more accurate measurement of position, the less accurate the measure of momentum
 * Heisenberg described quantum systems with matrices, while Schrödinger used wave theory
 * Quantum mechanics is a joint venture of both systems

==============================
| Copenhaugen interpretation |
==============================

 * Niels Bohr unified the matrix system and the wave system, mentioned above
 * Light is both a wave and a particle, think different

==============================
| Copenhaugen interpretation |
==============================

 * Schrödinger's cat is both dead and alive at the same time
 * It was an absurd argument, to show how silly the copenhagen interpretation is
 * The cat will be in a fuzzy blend of states, just like light is a wave and a particle according to Niels Bohr
 * Many say Scrödinger must simply accept the quantum world is weird

===================
| The EPR paradox |
===================

 * Eienstein Porolsky and Nathan Rosen did not believe in entanglement either, that a particle can have many states at once, to be "fuzzy"
 * Eienstein proved to be wrong here
 * Entanglement is real and might be used to make quantum computers...

===============================
| Pauli's exclusion principle |
===============================

 * Two electrons can not have the same wave, or quantum numbers
 * This is why you don't fall through things

=====================
| Superconductivity |
=====================

 * A material with no resistance is a superconductor
 * Mercury is a superconductor at 4.2 K
 * The energy in a superconductor is never lost and a current flows forever

=====================
| Rutherford's atom |
=====================

 * Atoms are not the smallest building lblocks
 * Josepth John Thomson discovered electrons and thought they were part of the nucleus
 * Ernest Rutherford discovered electrons are not part of the nucleus and invented the term nucleus
 * The hard core, the nucleus from Greek meaning kernel, consists of protons and neutrons

==============
| Antimatter |
==============

 * All particles have antimatter, where the quantum numbers have the opposite sign...
 * There is more matter than antimatter, for some reason

===================
| Nuclear fission |
===================

 * Fission comes from the division of a biological cell
 * The first fission reactor was made underneath Chicago football stadium by Fermi and colleagues

==================
| Nuclear fusion |
==================

 * All matter can be created by fusion
 * Fusion is a power source used across the universe

==================
| Standard model |
==================

 * The standard model is all of the particles which are known to man
 * Atoms consist of electrons, neutrinos, protons and neutrons
 * Protons consist of quarks
 * Quark: From the book Finnegans Wake meaning seagull cheer
 * Gravity is not part of the standard model, such a model would be called the grand unified theory (GUT)

====================
| Feynman Diagrams |
====================

 * Feynman diagrams describe how particles interact, much simpler than mathematics

====================
| The God particle |
====================

 * Peter Higgs thought of the Higgs particle
 * Higgs particles give matter mass

=================
| String theory |
=================

 * Alternative to the standard model
 * Popular in the media because of its name

======================
| Special relativity |
======================

 * Describes what happens in reference frames moving at constant speeds relative to one another
 * Since speed = distance / time and c = 3*10^8 m/s, constantly (always), distance and time must compensate when something moves at a speed
 * Planck read Eiensteins theory and made him famous
 * Mass grows according to E = mc^2, when something moves at c it will be infinitaly large

======================
| General relativity |
======================

 * Incorporate gravity and Newton's physics to special relativity
 * When someone is falling, a = g
 * In other words, general relativity is about accelerating reference frames

===============
| Black holes |
===============

 * Escape velocity on earth is 44 km/s
 * A black hole has so much mass its gravitational pull becomes impossible to escape
 * Used to be called frozen stars
 * The event horizon is the point of no return, time is observed to stop when something passes the event horizon
 * A lead ring may save your life if it is so heavy it counteracts the gravity gradient of the hole

===================
| Olbers' paradox |
===================

 * Why isn't the sky white at night?
 * Because the universe isn't infinite => There is a limit to how many stars there are
 * Also, stars which are far away red-shift, they become invisible eventually
 * Stars don't last forever, the bigger they are, the shorter their lifespans

================
| Hubble's law |
================

 * All galaxies move away from each-other
 * Rewind time, and they all end up at the same location
 * Hubble's law: How fast galaxies move away from each-other, they go faster the further away they are
 * Hubble's constant: Speed of a galaxy devided by distance traveled, about 75 km/s/megaparsec
 * The universe is expanding

================
